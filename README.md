# User Experience

## Project Discussion

The aim of this website is to provide people with the knowledge and tools to defend them selves online. It will feature helpful tips, tools to check if they have been exposed in a data breach and a password generator.

Key goals of this project:

* To enable users to defend themselves in an ever changing digital landscape.
* To educate young people and the elderly on what they can do to remain safe online.

- Allow users to see if their email has been involved in a data breach.
- Allow users to contact the designer should they have more questions.

### First-Time Visitor

As a first time visitor, I want to be able to;

# Design & User Interface

## Color Palette
![Color-Palette](docs/color-palette.png)

The palette I have chosen is based off of [this palette](https://www.behance.net/gallery/133126993/Tekmain), though I have modified the second colour from #85A60F to #87A810, this was to allow the second colour to pass the WebAIM WCAG AAA standards on the #0D0D0D background.

The main reason for this colour scheme is that I feel, if used appropriately, can give off a futuristic feeling to the website, much like that of Cyberpunk. This kind of theme I feel is used throughout security and will be attractive to the end user.

## Typography

- 'IBM Plex Sans' from Google Fonts. This is a Sans font and will be used for main content, such as paragraphs, buttons and anchor tags.
- 'IBM Plex Mono' from Google Fonts. This is a monospace font and will be used for headings.
